# Exploratory data analysis on Kaggle ML and DS surveys using Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

This project is an exploratory data analysis on Kaggle ML and DS surveys using Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Cleaned and analysed the demographics from two Kaggle machine learning & data science surveys which amounted to a data set of size 67620 rows & 7 columns.

Converted categorical data into numeric values with python groupby(), unstack(), and transpose() in order to understand the relationships between various demographics. I visualised the results of the data with seaborn, plotly, matplotlib, and squarify.

I was able to come to many conclusions about the demographics of the tech industry, including but not limited to: Data scientists are made up of an even spread of genders, data scientists have the most lucrative roles, and each gender has a relatively similar level of education.
